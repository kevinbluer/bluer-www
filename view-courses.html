              In this 10 week-course we explore what it takes to be successful web applications, from prototyping the early concept through to the actual build and ultimate deployment. Throughout the course students will prototype and build their own individual applications, all the while contributing to a “real-world” project that we would build collaboratively.

              Idea to App Store: Mobile App Workshop Series

              This Mobile App Workshop Series will give you everything you need to know to prototype and build your future iOS application. During the Bootcamp, we’ll explore all the fundamental aspects of what it takes to envision, design, and build a successful mobile application from the ground up using Apple’s new language "Swift" (targeting iOS 8 and using Xcode 6).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Workshop Series is split up in two weekends, which can be purchased separately. Both are designed for a non-technical audience and do not require any prior programming experience (although any experience is welcome). In weekend I we'll dive deep into the Mobile App ecosphere, define your app idea further, and do some designing and prototyping,. After weekend I you'll walk away with a designed prototype you can test further.
            </p>
            <p>
              In weekend II we'll actually start coding (using Apple's Swift Language) so your idea becomes a reality (if you already have your app developed, validated, tested and designed, you can start here). We'll also go into details about App Store rules and how to publish your App there. After this weekend you'll have a good basic knowledge of the Swift language, enough to get a basic App working, and put you firmly on the path towards more!
            </p>
            <p>
              During the Workshop Series we’ll explore a wide array of sample applications, backend frameworks, and tools & techniques. Additional topics will include Upcoming Mobile Trends, App Stores & Ecosystems, Mobile Design Principals, Prototyping Tools, The Software Development Lifecycle, Core Development Principals, Localization, and App Store Deployment Process.
